# Google Data Analytics – Cyclistic Case Study

This project explores usage patterns for Cyclistic, a fictional bike‑share company in Chicago. The goal is to understand how annual members and casual riders use the service differently, and to identify opportunities to convert casual riders into members.

This case study follows the full Google Data Analytics process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.
