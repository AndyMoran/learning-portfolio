# Learning Portfolio

This repository collects my completed course projects from the Google Data Analytics and IBM Data Science programmes. Each project is organised into its own folder with the final analysis, supporting files, and a short summary of the work.

The goal is clarity and structure: a single place to keep the coursework that shaped my foundations in analytics and data science, while keeping my independent projects (like the Falcon 9 Bayesian analysis) separate as exemplars.

## Project Structure

earning-portfolio/
│
├── Google_DA_Cyclistic/
│   └── Case study analysing bike-share usage patterns
│
├── Google_DA_Bellabeat/
│   └── Wellness product usage analysis for the Bellabeat capstone
│
└── IBM_DS_Falcon9/
└── IBM Data Science capstone project (SpaceX Falcon 9 launch analysis)


Each folder contains the final project files, cleaned and organised for readability.

## Purpose

This portfolio serves two roles:

1. **A record of completed coursework**  
   It shows the progression through structured learning programmes and the practical exercises completed along the way.

2. **A foundation for more advanced, independent work**  
   My standalone Falcon 9 Bayesian reliability project builds on the skills developed here and lives in its own repository.

## Independent Exemplar Project

For a deeper example of my technical and analytical work, see:

## Next Steps

- Add short READMEs inside each project folder  
- Clean and standardise file naming  
- Add environment or requirements notes where useful  

This repo will grow as I complete additional courses and refine earlier work.
