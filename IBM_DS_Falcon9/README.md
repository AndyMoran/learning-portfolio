# IBM Data Science – Falcon 9 Launch Analysis (Capstone)

This project analyzes SpaceX Falcon 9 launch data to estimate the probability of booster recovery and to explore the factors that influence landing success. It was completed as the capstone project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate.

## Objectives

- Explore launch outcomes across years, sites, and mission types  
- Identify features associated with successful landings  
- Build predictive models for landing success  
- Present insights in a clear, business‑focused narrative  

---

## Key Findings

- Landing success improves sharply over time, especially after Block 5  
- Mission profile and landing type (RTLS vs ASDS) strongly affect outcomes  
- Payload mass and orbit class influence recovery difficulty  
- A simple classification model can predict landing success with high accuracy  

---

## Deliverables

- Cleaned launch dataset  
- Exploratory data analysis and visualizations  
- Predictive modelling (logistic regression, decision trees, etc.)  
- A final presentation summarizing insights  

---

## Tools Used

- Python  
- pandas, numpy  
- matplotlib, seaborn  
- scikit‑learn  
- Jupyter Notebook

This project provided a foundation in data wrangling, visualization, and predictive modelling, and it set the stage for my independent Falcon 9 Bayesian reliability analysis.
